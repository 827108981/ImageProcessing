
To implement this algorithm, run "Hybrid_MSD_Fusion_test.m".
If there is a problem, you may run "Compile.m" first,
If still exists, please contact zhzhzhou@bit.edu.cn

The algorithm was proposed in:
 
Zhiqiang Zhou et al. "Perceptual fusion of infrared and visible images through 
a hybrid multi-scale decomposition with Gaussian and bilateral filters", 
Information Fusion, 30, 15-26, 2016.

Please cite the above paper if you use the code.
